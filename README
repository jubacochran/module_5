This application explores the 'coupons.csv' dataset and assumes behaviors based on observations using the Central Limit Theorem, multivariate distributions, normal distributions, and correlation matrix.

1. Introduction
Problem Statement: Will the customer accept the coupon?

In general, people were less likely to accept the coupons when considering the entire population. Here are the statistics for the Yes vs. No of the entire population:

Population proportion of coupon acceptance:

56.84% of the population chose to accept the coupon, while 43.16% decided not to use the coupon.
Breakdown by category: (Image at /images/category_of_coupon_proportions.png)

0	1
Bar	58.998513	41.001487
Carry out & Take away	26.452152	73.547848
Coffee House	50.075075	49.924925
Restaurant(20-50)	55.898123	44.101877
Restaurant(<20)	29.289304	70.710696
Next, a histogram was created to visualize the 'temperature' column. The histogram was skewed due to null data. You can see from the central tendency values below that most data points were only plotted for 30, 50, and 80 degrees: (Image located at /images/temp_hist.png)

Temperature:

False: 12,684
Count: 12,684.000000
Mean: 63.301798
Std. Dev.: 19.154486
Min: 30.000000
25th percentile: 55.000000
50th percentile: 80.000000
75th percentile: 80.000000
Max: 80.000000
I used theoretical and empirical probability to better understand and visualize the data.

Using a uniform probability distribution method from scipy.stats, I processed the data. You can view the overlaid plot at /images/Uniform_Distribution_PDF.

I employed the law of large numbers to fill in the area under the continuous distribution. Here is what I observed:

Mean: 55.0
Variance: 208.33333333333331
How I defined the distribution and what sample size I used can be found in the code under the temperature section.

Moving on to the coupon section, I attempted to answer more questions about the drivers who accepted the coupon.

Based on calculations from the dataset, younger drivers who were not widowed were more likely to accept bar coupons and trended toward going to cheaper restaurants. (This can be observed in "Acceptance Rate for Set 1-3, as mentioned previously.")

Stats: (Image at /images/acceptancep1.png)

Acceptance Rate for Set 1 (No kids and not Widowed): 0.71
Acceptance Rate for Set 2 (Under Age 30): 0.73
Acceptance Rate for Set 3 (Cheap Restaurants, 4 times a month, Income ~$50K): 0.84
Younger drivers accepted bar coupons more than older age groups:

Acceptance Rate for drivers over 25 who go to bars frequently and accepted the coupon: 14.4
Acceptance Rate for all other bar visitors: 17.4
Drivers who visited the bar less often were more likely to accept the coupons. (This was surprising; I thought those who frequented bars would accept the coupons more often.)

Stats:

Acceptance Rate for 3 or fewer times to the Bar: 25.29
Acceptance Rate for 4 or more times to the Bar: 7.59
Finally, I created a correlation matrix to identify strong relationships in columns with integer data, such as the number of children and distance to the coupon. Unfortunately, the only strong correlation was between each variable and itself. All other data had weak or no correlation between pairs. (See /images/heatmap_of_int_variables).

Independent Investigation
I wanted to see if patterns would change if the coupon was for a coffee shop.

I discovered that drivers who accepted the coffee coupon made up only 15.7% of the total population.

As expected, those looking for more energy in the morning were in the older age group and better paid. Having kids did not have the same impact on the acceptance rate as for the younger age group visiting bars. (This is good news.)

To observe any changes in acceptance, I modified my dataframe query to reflect the categorical opposites of the previous Sets 1-3. This time, I filtered for higher salaries, kids as passengers, and marital status as "Married partner." (Image at /images/acceptance2.png)

Acceptance Rates:

Set 1 (Kids and married): 0.65
Set 2 (Age 41 or older): 0.73
Set 3 (Expensive Restaurants, Income ~$100,000K): 0.72
As a final effort to understand the dataset, I combined the accepted Sets 1-3 of the bar with the accepted Sets 1-3 of the coffee shop. I found that the bar had only slightly more acceptance than the coffee shop, even though the conditions were very different. However, it seems that people love to eat regardless. As long as it's within their budget, they will spend similarly on expensive or cheap restaurants, according to this data plot. (Image at /images/acceptance_rates_combined.png)

Next Steps:
I found it challenging to visualize data in a way that I could drive solid business decision making. Although this was a high dimensional dataset, I beleive more data is required in order to make a business decision to move forward with this coupon campaign. I beleive we
need more detailed data or a deeper analysis to arrive at such of a decision.
